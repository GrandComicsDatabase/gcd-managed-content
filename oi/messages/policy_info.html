{% comment %}
This file is for informing indexers and editors of recent rule changes or
similar information while they are looking at queues in the OI.

Place all content inside the open <div> and close </div> tags.

Do not use any additional <div> tags, as you can easily break the layout
by not closing them correctly.

Use <p> tags to separate content into paragraphs.  The browser automatically
closes <p> tags as needed (although you can also close them manually).

You can change the header in the <h2> tags as needed, but please leave
the <h2> tags as they are.

Note that the heading and div (with placeholder content) are left visible by
default to ensure that developers are aware of the box placement.
