  <h3 class="label-gcd-blue">Cloudflare</h3>
  <div class="px-1">
    We are using Cloudflare as an external service to prevent misbehaving bots overloading our webserver.
    These measures are preventing excessive use of our site, e.g. due to accessing many pages in a few seconds.  
    Sometimes we need to turn on enhanced services of Cloudflare, then an interstitial Challenge Page will appear regularly. 
    <p>
     Turning off these measures is not an option for us. Our site would be regularly unresponsive due to the bots 
      (which are often AI-related bots).
    </p>
    <p>
     If you are getting blocked, this is almost always temporarily for a few minutes. If this persists,
    these are recommendations one can find for those who have issues with Cloudflare:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc ps-6">
      <li> Make sure your browsers are up to date, or try a different browser.
      </li>

      <li>Disable any browser extensions (at least for our website) that may interfere (e.g., ad blockers, privacy extensions).
      Since we don't serve ads any more, these extension don't have an effect on our site anyway.
      </li> 

      <li>Try accessing the website using a different device or network to see if the issue persists. 
      </li>
      <li>Avoid opening many pages into different tabs in quick succession.
      </li>
    </ul>

<h3 class="label-gcd-blue">Volunteers Wanted For Adding New Comics</h3>
  <div class='ps-1'>
    <p class="mb-2">
Each week, a small number of GCD volunteers add listings to our database for the new comics released that week in North America.
These are just the basic listings, not full indexes.
This makes it easier for other volunteers who upload covers and for indexers, as well as for people using <a class="no_visited" href="https://my.comics.org">my.comics.org</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
Each volunteer covers one publisher or a small group of publishers ("D publishers except DC", for example).
From public sources such as ComicsList and Diamond Previews online, they add the issues and make note of the prices and a few other details.
We are looking for additional volunteers for this weekly task.
    </p>
Follow <a class="no_visited" href="https://docs.comics.org/wiki/New_Releases_Skeletons">this link</a> for a description of the process and a list of which publishers are currently covered.
