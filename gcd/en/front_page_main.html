Prefer <p> instead of <div> for paragraphs of content.  Web browsers will
automatically close <p> tags, making them less likely to break layout.

Remember to close all list tags, including nested list.  You need a
close tag for each open tag.  Indent contents inside of tags to make
it easy to spot unclosed tags.

Use the class attribute to make announcements (which will appear in an
inviting color) or call attention to something (a warning color).

<p>
This will not have a background color.
<p class="announcment">
This will be a nice color like pale green or maybe light blue.
<p class="attention">
This will have something like a yellow color.

If you need to use multiple paragraphs for an announcement or attention,
instead of putting the class on the <p> tags, wrap all of the paragraphs
between a <div> and </div>, each on their own line before and after the
group of paragraphs.  Indent all content within the div tags to make it
clear that you are inside of a tag that requires an explict closing
tag.  Omitting the close </div> will break the page's layout.

Put the class on the opening div tag.
<div class="announcement">
  <p>
  First paragraph of announcement.
  <p>
  Second paragraph of announcement.
</div>

To show a milestone with a cover scan, use a div with the "milestone" class.
Put the image tag first, then an <h3>Header Tag</h3> with the milestone
title, then as many <p> paragraphs as you'd like.  Again, indent
everything within the <div>s to make sure you can tell that you closed
the div.  The <img /> tag closes itself (that's why it has that extra /
at the end).  You do not need to set the image width or do anything
to get it to sit to the left of the text.

<div class="milestone">
  <img src="/path/to/the/cover/img.jpg" alt="Cover Image" />
  <h3>We did 1,000,000,000 things!</h3>
  <p>
  This is some text about the things that we did.
  <p>
  And a bit more text.
</div>

You can put as many of these as you want on a page.  Always close
the first milestone div before opening the next one.  This will cause
them to stack nicely with the other content.
