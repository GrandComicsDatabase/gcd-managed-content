Prefer <p> instead of <div> for paragraphs of content.  Web browsers will
automatically close <p> tags, making them less likely to break layout.
Remember to close all list tags, including nested list.  You need a
close tag for each open tag.  Indent contents inside of tags to make
it easy to spot unclosed tags.
Use the class attribute to make announcements (which will appear in an
inviting color) or call attention to something (a warning color).
<p>
This will not have a background color.
<p class="announcment">
This will be a nice color like pahttps://my.comics.org/feature/34/issues/le green or maybe light blue.
<p class="attention">
This will have something like a yellow color.
If you need to use multiple paragraphs for an announcement or attention,
instead of putting the class on the <p> tags, wrap all of the paragraphs
between a <div> and </div>, each on their own line before and after the
group of paragraphs.  Indent all content within the div tags to make it
clear that you are inside of a tag that requires an explict closing
tag.  Omitting the close </div> will break the page's layout.
Put the class on the opening div tag.
<div class="announcement">
  <p>
  First paragraph of announcement.
  <p>
  Second paragraph of announcement.
</div>
To show a milestone with a cover scan, use a div with the "milestone" class.
Put the image tag first, then an <h3>Header Tag</h3> with the milestone
title, then as many <p> paragraphs as you'd like.  Again, indent
everything within the <div>s to make sure you can tell that you closed
the div.  The <img /> tag closes itself (that's why it has that extra /
at the end).  You do not need to set the image width or do anything
to get it to sit to the left of the text.
<div class="milestone">
  <img src="/path/to/the/cover/img.jpg" alt="Cover Image" />
  <h3>We did 1,000,000,000 things!</h3>
  <p>
  This is some text about the things that we did.
  <p>
  And a bit more text.
</div>
You can put as many of these as you want on a page.  Always close
the first milestone div before opening the next one.  This will cause
them to stack nicely with the other content.

GCD while he wrote comics professionally.

<h3 class="label-gcd-blue -mx-2">Updates To The Site! (Q2 2025)</h3>

	<p class="pb-2">
Besides updating and renovating our page designs, in particular making it useable on small screens, we made a couple of changes on the behaviour of the site.
	</p>

	<p class="pb-2">
The result tables and lists are now more consistent throughout the site. On many pages you now fill find these two symbols
    <svg class="inline border border-gray-400 px-1 py-1 h-9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><g><path d="m 9 3 h 6 v 2 h -6 z m 0 0"/><path d="m 9 7 h 6 v 2 h -6 z m 0 0"/><path d="m 9 11 h 6 v 2 h -6 z m 0 0"/><path d="m 1 3 h 6 v 2 h -6 z m 0 0"/><path d="m 1 7 h 6 v 2 h -6 z m 0 0"/><path d="m 1 11 h 6 v 2 h -6 z m 0 0"/></g></svg>
	<svg class="inline border border-gray-400 px-1 py-1 w-9 h-9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path d="m 1.992188 0 c -1.089844 0 -2.0000005 0.910156 -2.0000005 2 v 3 c 0 1.089844 0.9101565 2 2.0000005 2 h 3 c 1.089843 0 2 -0.910156 2 -2 v -3 c 0 -1.089844 -0.910157 -2 -2 -2 z m 8 0 c -1.089844 0 -2 0.910156 -2 2 v 3 c 0 1.089844 0.910156 2 2 2 h 3 c 1.089843 0 2 -0.910156 2 -2 v -3 c 0 -1.089844 -0.910157 -2 -2 -2 z m -8 2 h 3 v 3 h -3 z m 8 0 h 3 v 3 h -3 z m -8 6 c -1.089844 0 -2.0000005 0.910156 -2.0000005 2 v 3 c 0 1.089844 0.9101565 2 2.0000005 2 h 3 c 1.089843 0 2 -0.910156 2 -2 v -3 c 0 -1.089844 -0.910157 -2 -2 -2 z m 8 0 c -1.089844 0 -2 0.910156 -2 2 v 3 c 0 1.089844 0.910156 2 2 2 h 3 c 1.089843 0 2 -0.910156 2 -2 v -3 c 0 -1.089844 -0.910157 -2 -2 -2 z m -8 2 h 3 v 3 h -3 z m 8 0 h 3 v 3 h -3 z m 0 0"/></svg>.
By clicking on them one can switch with a list view and an image view, e.g. using covers or creator faces.
	</p>

	<p class="pb-2">
Filtering of search results or lists is now usually available.
	</p>
    
    <p class="pb-2">
      To avoid visual information overload in case of many variants or reprints, we show the full list only if their number is below a threshold.
	Logged-in users can set the thresholds in their profile to allow user-defined display.      
    </p>
    <p class="pb-2">
      The functionality for adding issues to a collection, or editing their collection status, is now accessible on the main site.
    </p>
    
    <p class="pb-2">
      Most data objects now support markdown in the notes for visual structure. 
      Notes now also support internal links, these are generated automatically and shown with the object name, e.g.
 [gcd_link_issue](442), or generally [gcd_link_'object_type'](id) 
    </p>

    <p class="pb-2">
      We changed the colors on the series status tables for a more consistent appearance. For issues, we added another layer to indicate that some sequence data is present.
    </p>
    
    <p class="pb-2">
      Keywords are now generally clickable troughout the site.
    </p>

Due to a United States IRS ruling regarding advertising revenue as taxable business income, 
  we will no longer be displaying paid advertising on the website.  
  <p>
    
  This is good news for all our users, but we are now fully dependent on donations to cover our costs in the future.

<h2>Cloudflare Verification</h2>

<p>
We sometimes need to turn on enhanced services of Cloudflare to prevent misbehaving users and bots to overload our webserver. 
This service by Cloudflare is used by many, many websites for this purpose. 
</p>

<p>
These are recommendations one can find for those who have issues with Cloudflare:
</p>

<ol>
<li> Make sure your browsers are up to date, or try a different browser.
</li>
  
<li>Disable any browser extensions (at least for the specific website) that may interfere with the captcha (e.g., ad blockers, privacy extensions).
Since we don't serve ads anymore, these extension don't have an effect on our site anyway.
</li> 
  
<li>Try accessing the website using a different device or network to see if the issue persists. 
</li>
</ol>
As an all-volunteer organisation we cannot react to individual access problems due to the Cloudflare verification to our free website. 
It has nothing to do with our setup in any case.
